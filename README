## Basic Concepts

Miscellaneous concepts and topics that I haven't covered, but don't really fit in to any other course.

- callbacks
- closures
- equality
- objects
- promise
- prototypes

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Course will
cover existing JavaScript data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps. Topics also include how to implement other
common data structures/algorithms such as stacks, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc...

- arrays
  - joining multiple arrays
  - iterator functions
  - es6 array features
  - sorting
  - searching
  - displaying as string
- stacks
- queue
- priority queue
- linked list
- sets
- dictionaries
- hash tables
- map
- weakmap & weakset
- trees
- graphs
- sorting algorithms
- searching algorithms
- recursion
- greedy algorithms
- big o / algorithm complexity

## ES6 Features

Overview of all the new features, syntax, and changes in ES6.

- let
- arrow functions
- template literals
- spread operator
- classes
- inheritance
- generators

## Using ES6

To enable ES6 support in any JetBrains IDE *(such as WebStorm)*:
- File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript
- Select EMCAScript 6
